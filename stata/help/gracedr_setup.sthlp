{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:gracedr setup} checks the options, then creates the study folder and five datasets in it:
{cmd:design.dta}, {cmd:participants.dta}, {cmd:codes.dta}, {cmd:audit.dta} and
{cmd:state.dta}. It stops before it writes anything if an option or the codes file is wrong,
and it refuses to run when the folder already holds a study. Your data in memory and your own
random number generator are not changed.

{pstd}
If a write fails part way, the command says so and names the files to remove before setup is run
again. A folder that existed before setup is never deleted.

{pstd}
Balance variables are kept in a fixed order: every {opt categorical()} variable in the order
written, then every {opt continuous()} variable. {opt weights()} follows that order, whatever
order the options were typed in. Levels are trimmed and lower-cased.

{pstd}
Without {opt seed()}, setup picks a seed from the clock, shows it, and stores it in
{cmd:state.dta}. A study keeps its own random number stream, so the seed and the stored state
reproduce every draw. A seed taken from the clock is not secret, so give {opt seed()} yourself
when the seed must not be guessable.

{pstd}
Arm labels and levels must not contain double quotes, backticks or dollar signs.


{title:Examples}

{pstd}
Run an example once. To run it again, delete the study folder first.

{phang2}{cmd:. gracedr setup, study("`c(tmpdir)'/my study") n(40) arms(A B)}
{cmd:categorical(sex: male female | race: white black other) continuous(age)}
{cmd:codes("stata/data/example_codes.csv") seed(20260611)}{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. gracedr setup, study("`c(tmpdir)'/three arms") n(90) arms(A B C)}
{cmd:ratio(2 1 1) categorical(sex: male female) runin(0)}{p_end}


{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:gracedr setup} stores {cmd:r(seed)} (the seed used) and {cmd:r(study)} (the normalized
folder).
