{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:gracedr codes} reads a treatment codes file and checks it. It needs no study. The file is
a CSV or a Stata dataset (a name ending in {cmd:.dta}) with the columns {cmd:code} and
{cmd:arm}. Numeric codes in a Stata dataset must be whole numbers; they are turned into text.
Values are trimmed, and leading zeros in a CSV are kept.

{pstd}
The command stops with a message when a column is missing, the file has no rows, a code is
empty or repeated, or an arm is blank or not one of {opt arms()}. When it stops, the data in
memory is left as it was.

{pstd}
When the file is valid, the data in memory is replaced by the codes with the columns
{cmd:code}, {cmd:arm}, {cmd:status} (all {cmd:unused}) and {cmd:id} (empty). This is the layout
of {cmd:codes.dta} in a study folder.
