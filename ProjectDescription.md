# graceDR: project description

graceDR is an R package that randomizes clinical trial participants one at a time into one of
`k` groups while keeping the groups balanced on chosen baseline variables and, at chosen
enrollment totals, exactly the prescribed sizes. It was built by Dr. James W. Hardin (Professor
of Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of South Carolina)
and Grace Huiyi Ma (a junior in the Dutch Fork High School STEM Magnet Program, Irmo, South
Carolina), with Claude, from a written specification. Version 0.1.0 is licensed under GPL-3 and
lives in the public repository `BiostatDoc/graceDR`.

The package is named `graceDR`, not `grace` as in the specification, because the name `grace`
conflicts with an archived CRAN package named Grace.

## What the package does

The package modifies the minimal sufficient balance (MSB) algorithm of Zhao, Hill, and Palesch
([doi:10.1177/0962280212436447](https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280212436447)). At setup the user
specifies:

- the variables over which balance is wanted (for example sex, race, and age category) and the
  values each can take, categorical or continuous;
- a weight for each variable, which expresses its importance to the balance;
- the randomization proportions for the groups, for any number of groups and any ratio;
- the enrollment totals at which the proportions must hold exactly;
- an optional file of treatment codes, and a seed.

At each randomization the user supplies a participant ID and the values of the balance
variables. The program draws the assignment, saves the record, and, if codes are used, returns
an unused treatment code for the assigned group.

The modifications to MSB are:

- **Weights.** Balance variables carry weights that are rescaled to add to one.
- **Biased coin.** The coin probability is an option and defaults to the 0.65 recommended for
  the original algorithm.
- **Run-in.** The first `max(10, ceiling(0.10 N))` participants, rounded up to a size that the
  allocation ratios divide exactly, are held to the prescribed proportions. For two equal groups
  and a run-in of 10, that means exactly 5 and 5.
- **Forced totals.** The prescribed proportions are also forced at any list of enrollment totals
  and at the final sample size.
- **Group size controls.** A group-size vote and a bound on how far a group may drift from its
  target (3 by default) pull a group that falls behind back toward its target.
- **Many groups.** With two groups the rule reduces to the original MSB algorithm.

A missing balance value is allowed. That variable does not vote for that participant, and the
program prints a warning. Deterministic assignments (probability 0 or 1) near the enrollment
totals are expected, because they keep the prescribed proportions.

## Who uses it

Only the unblinded statistician uses the program. One statistician runs every randomization from
one computer, so the program does not handle two people at once and does not lock files. The
statistician can:

- randomize each participant, with a participant ID that can be any string and is rejected if it
  repeats;
- print the current group sizes and balance without randomizing anyone;
- override an assignment through a function that records the time, the old value, the new value,
  and a required reason;
- replay any past assignment for an audit;
- run simulations of the algorithm against other methods.

Users never edit the saved trial by hand.

## Outputs

After each randomization, and from the status-only function, the program returns data frames and
ggplot objects and prints a short summary:

- a group size table with the count and percent in each group and the target count at the next
  enrollment total;
- a covariate balance table with counts and percents by group for categorical variables, the mean
  and standard deviation by group for continuous variables, and a standardized mean difference
  (SMD) for each variable;
- a cumulative imbalance plot showing each group's deviation from its target count by enrollment
  order, with the enrollment totals marked;
- an SMD (Love) plot of the absolute SMD of each variable, with a reference line at 0.1.

The status report can be limited to an enrollment range (for example participants 41 to 80), to
the state at a named enrollment total, or to a subset of the balance variables.

## Metrics

The simulation reports these measures for each allocation method, with the 95th and 99th
percentiles and the maximum over the simulated trials to show worst cases:

- **Covariate balance.** The largest absolute SMD over the variables, and the SMD of each
  variable, at the end of the run-in, at each enrollment total, and at the end. For a binary
  indicator with proportions 0.60 and 0.50 in the two groups, the SMD is
  (0.60 - 0.50) / sqrt((0.60 x 0.40 + 0.50 x 0.50) / 2) = 0.10 / 0.495, which is 0.20.
- **Size deviation.** The absolute difference between a group's count and its target count, at the
  same points. With 7 participants and two equal groups the targets are 4 and 3, with the extra
  place going to the first group.
- **Predictability.** The percent of assignments that are deterministic, the longest run of
  consecutive forced assignments to the same group, and the Blackwell–Hodges correct-guess
  probability ([doi:10.1214/aoms/1177706973](https://doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177706973)), which is
  the expected chance that a guesser who always picks the group furthest behind its target is
  right.

The comparison methods are simple random allocation, permuted blocks, Pocock–Simon minimization
([doi:10.2307/2529712](https://doi.org/10.2307/2529712)), and unmodified MSB. Synthetic
participants come from the trial's own balance variables, with level probabilities (or a mean and
standard deviation for continuous variables) and an optional linear drift from start to end values
over enrollment. A user can instead supply a function that returns participants. The package ships
example generators with and without drift.

## Data handling

- **One encrypted file.** The trial state is one `.rds` file encrypted with a passphrase. It holds
  the design, participants, assignments, treatment codes, random-number states, and audit log.
  The passphrase is entered each session or read from an environment variable, and is never
  written to disk.
- **Safe writes.** Before each write the program keeps a backup of the previous version.
- **Audit log.** Every randomization and override adds an entry to an append-only log.
- **Replay.** Setup takes a seed, and each record stores the random-number state used for its
  draw, so any assignment can be replayed. The program saves and restores the user's own
  random-number state, so it never disturbs their session.
- **Treatment codes.** The codes come from a CSV file with columns `code` and `arm`. Each
  randomization takes a random unused code for the assigned group and marks it used. If the group
  has no codes left, the program stops with an error and saves nothing. An example code list ships
  with the package.
- **Trial database.** The trial measurements live in a separate database, likely REDCap. The
  statistician copies the participant ID and treatment code into it by hand.
- **Size.** The specification targets trials up to N = 5,000 and simulations up to 10,000 trials.
  The package updates its state incrementally in simulation and offers optional parallel
  simulation. A single simulated trial of 5,000 participants ran in about 3 seconds on a laptop.

All examples and tests use small made-up data. The repository contains no real patient or
company data.

## Access

Only the unblinded statistician runs the program or sees its output, and access depends on the
passphrase for the encrypted file. The program produces nothing for blinded staff.

## Out of scope

- Connecting to the trial database.
- Several people randomizing at once, and file locking.
- Blinded exports and blinded reports.

## How the work was managed

### From specification to pull requests

The work moved through four stages.

1. **Specification.** `Specification.md` describes what the product does, who uses it, the
   screens, the metrics, the data, access, known problems in an earlier version, and what is out
   of scope. It also fixes the engineering conventions: R 4.6 or higher, `styler`, `lintr`, and
   `testthat`, a Makefile with `format`, `lint`, `test`, and `pre-pr` targets, and a GPL-3 license.
2. **Implementation plan.** `docs/ImplementationPlan.md` turns the specification into a package
   layout, data shapes, the algorithm step by step, the comparison methods, the CI jobs, and an
   ordered list of work.
3. **Jira cards.** The plan was split into cards in the Jira project GRACE, grouped into six
   epics. Each card was written so that a smaller model could implement it without the planning
   conversation: it names the files to create or change, the commands, the function signatures,
   the data shapes, and the edge cases, and its acceptance criteria name the tests that must pass.
   Cards list which cards block them, so the work was done in dependency order.
4. **Pull requests.** Each card was implemented on its own branch in its own git worktree, named
   after the card, and delivered as one GitHub pull request titled `[GRACE-n] Card title`.

### Checks on every change

Before a branch is pushed, `make pre-pr` runs the formatter, the linter, and the tests, in that
order, and must pass. On GitHub, continuous integration runs three jobs on every pull request and
every change to `main`:

- `lint` checks the formatting with `styler` and runs `lintr`;
- `test` runs the `testthat` tests;
- `check` runs `R CMD check` with warnings treated as errors, on Linux and Windows.

The repository allows only squash merges and deletes each branch after it merges. A ruleset named
"Protect main" blocks deleting `main` and force pushes, requires a pull request, and requires the
`lint` and `test` checks to pass. Dr. Hardin reviews each pull request and approves it with a
comment before it is merged, and a card moves to Done only after its pull request merges. The
19 squashed commits that delivered the cards each list Claude Sonnet 5.5 as co-author.

## Where the project stands

The package has more than 800 passing test expectations, a vignette, a README, and a manuscript
for the Journal of Statistical Software in the `JSSarticle` folder. It is prepared for CRAN as
version 0.1.0.

The specification left one question open: whether the modifications to MSB improve performance
over the comparison methods. The manuscript reports simulations of 1,000 trials in each of four
settings (200 or 500 participants, with and without drift in the enrolled population):

- The modified procedure met the run-in and final group sizes in every trial. Unmodified MSB
  missed the final sizes by a mean of 5.7 to 10.7 participants.
- Its covariate balance was better than simple randomization and permuted blocks, and slightly
  worse than unmodified MSB.
- Minimization balanced covariates best in every setting, but its final group sizes were exact in
  fewer than half of the trials.
- Its expected correct-guess probability was 58.5% to 59.4%, compared with 70.8% for permuted
  blocks and 61.6% to 62.2% for minimization.

So the modifications deliver exact group sizes at chosen totals with less predictability than
permuted blocks, at a small cost in balance relative to MSB. They do not give better balance than
minimization in these simulations.
